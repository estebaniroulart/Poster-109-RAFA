"fig2_snaps_SFS" contains representative snapshots and structure factors for Model I/Model II
"fig4_chi_vs_T_L2" shows chirality scaled with L**2 for different sizes L=30,48,60 for different magnetic fields
"fig5" and "fig7" contains density plot of Chirality in the B-T parameter space for Model I and Model II, respectively
